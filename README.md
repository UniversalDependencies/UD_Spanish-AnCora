# Summary

Spanish data from the [AnCora](http://clic.ub.edu/corpus/) corpus.


# Introduction

The original annotation was done in a constituency framework as a part of the
[AnCora](http://clic.ub.edu/corpus/) project at the University of Barcelona.
It was converted to dependencies and used in the
[CoNLL 2009 shared task](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/conll2009-st/index.html).
The CoNLL 2009 version was later converted to
[HamleDT](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/hamledt) and to Universal Dependencies.

The GNU license is inherited from the original dataset, downloaded from
the AnCora website. Any license-related questions have to be directed to
the original data providers at the University of Barcelona (that is, not
to the UD contact address listed at the end of this README file).
